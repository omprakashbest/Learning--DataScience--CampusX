Minimum Score of a Path Between two cities

->  You are given a positive integer n representing n cities numbered from 1 to n, You are also given a 2D array 
roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi, distancei] indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities ai and bi
with a distance equal to distancei. the cities graph is not necessarily connected.

The score of a path between two cities is defined as the minimum distance of a road in this path.

Return the minimum possible score of a path between cities 1 and n.

Note:

• A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
• It is allowed for a path to contain the same road multiple times, and you can visit cities 1 and n multiple 
    times along the path.
• The test cases are generated such that there is at least one path between 1 and n.
