-> Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List

In a Linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of hte linked list is known as the twin
of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.

• For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2, These are the only
nodes with twins for n = 4.

The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.
